# pswrd_entropy_gen
This project is a simple but powerful tool to create secure passwords based on **entropy** \(information theory)

## Description
This is a password generator based on entropy in bits, this means that the passwords created can be measured on
how much is possible to guess the password based on its randomness and can calculate how much time it would need to be decrypted.
The generator is a class called Generator \(of course) and has 4 methods involved:
